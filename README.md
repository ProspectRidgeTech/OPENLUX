# OpenLUX

An open source, affordable microplate reader for everyone.

## Documentation Note
The demand for a rapid development pace means that documentation has fallen a
long ways behind. Things will be cleaned up and commented in September.

## TODO
* Better error handling
* Pick char* or char[]
* Add a way to stop sensor polling
* Add graphing
* Add well selection
* Arrow keys to home
* Add homing to web interface
* Store homing on flash
* Slay global mutable variables
* Reduce as many hard-coded values as possible
* Add lots more logging
* Only allow certain actions when the machine is in a certain state
* Allow status to be reverted to previous status
* Combine all requests to the device into one (sensors & status)
